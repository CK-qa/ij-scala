Scala does not require the developer to use <code>override</code> on methods that implement abstract members.
Nonetheless, it is a good idea to mark such methods with <code>override</code> to be notified
by the compiler when the override relationship gets broken (by a subsequent refactoring, for example).

<br />
This inspection reports functions that override abstract members but do not have an override modifier.

<p>
    Before:
<pre>
trait Base {
  def fun(): Int
}

class Impl extends Base {
  def fun(): Int = 42
}
</pre>

<br>
After:
<pre>
trait Base {
  def fun(): Int
}

class Impl extends Base {
  override def fun(): Int = 42
}
</pre>
</p>
